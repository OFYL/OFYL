Hi I'm Ila! I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Edinburgh studying cognitive science with a specialisation in linguistics. 

Frustrated with the lack of research opportunities, I decided to take matters into my own hands to create a website that has information on research and general linguistics points of interest that 
high school, undergraduate, and postgraduate students can have - all in one place!

If you have any inquiries (or opportunities you might have heard of) you can reach me at: opportunitiesforyounglinguists@gmail.com !
